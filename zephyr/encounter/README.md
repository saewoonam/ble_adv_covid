# Encounter Tracing


## Overview

A application that attempts to demonstrate an encounter tracing protocol.  It is different than other protocols.  Instead of advertising and recording anonymized IDs from other bluetooth devices... It generates a shared key via public/private key protocols.  This key identifies a potential encounter.  The bluetooth devices logs encounter IDs for comparison later via a public server.
